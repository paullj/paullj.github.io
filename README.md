# Personal Website and Blog

This is my personal website. It is built using Astro and deployed to GitHub Pages. The site is based on this [template](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus), with some minor modifications such as adding comments via [giscus](https://giscus.app/) and some minor styling tweaks. Feel free to use this template for your own site or adapt bits of it you like.
