Access to energy is an enabler and central to achieving many of the other SDGs.</p>\n<p>The most economical way of achieving electrification in remote and peri-urban settings is through DC mini-grids and solar home systems. With the turn of the decade, access to energy in developing regions is growing. The IEA forecasts more than 600 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa need to be served by an off-grid renewable solution by 2030 to meet SDG 7.</p>\n<figure class=\"rehype-figure\"><img\n  src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8403295/152995300-5fe27923-82b0-45e3-8bf9-0cad2841080e.png\"\n  alt=\"As population density decreases, solar home systems and minigrids become the most affordable way of providing electricity top homes\"\n><figcaption>As population density decreases, solar home systems and minigrids become the most affordable way of providing electricity top homes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Conventional, inefficient appliances use far too much energy to be used affordably with off-grid solar home systems or mini-grids. The burden of inefficient appliances can overload these small systems causing load shedding and outages. More efficient, intentionally designed off-grid electrical appliances need to be designed to meet this energy demand; and that is what the Efficiency for Access design challenge sets out to achieve.</p>\n<figure class=\"rehype-figure\"><img\n  src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8403295/152995434-7cd5baf0-ee28-4612-bf0e-cc5dfa32832e.png\"\n  alt=\"Infographic of the initial proposal and intended design.\"\n><figcaption>Infographic of the initial proposal and intended design.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Our appliance provides a method of boiling water to Kenya, a DC vacuum insulated kettle with an integrated filter. The insulation minimises heat loss meaning the water will retain its heat for many hours and the kettle will not have to be re-boiled. This saves the user both time, and cost associated with energy use. The activated carbon and alumina filter removes contaminants that cannot be removed via boiling.</p>\n<figure class=\"rehype-figure\"><img\n  src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8403295/152995723-18af1a42-485e-488e-9841-035117610739.png\"\n  alt=\"Filter components and potential contaminants\"\n><figcaption>Filter components and potential contaminants</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The project followed a user-driven development framework to make sure that we follow the challenge brief of providing valuable impact to people’s lives.</p>\n<figure class=\"rehype-figure\"><img\n  src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8403295/152995825-c0186a95-568c-4435-858a-97b9c7451c93.png\"\n  alt=\"User centred or user driven development framework\"\n><figcaption>User centred or user driven development framework</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In the concept design stage, for example, sketches were used to generate ideas; a user study was also conducted to investigate potential benefits of the proposed reduced boil time.

A kettle cannot eliminate all of this, like collecting water each day, but it can reduce domestic burden.</p>\n<figure class=\"rehype-figure\"><img\n  src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8403295/152996207-f342b546-425f-4531-bc35-e0af88191106.png\"\n  alt=\"Example of main assembly drawing\"\n><figcaption>Example of main assembly drawing</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This information drove the design specification which was then used to produce detailed designs of for each subsystem of the kettle.
